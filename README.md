# X-Plane 11 custom replacement alert sounds
## Replacement alert sounds for X-Plane 11 including GPWS, glide-slope, terrain and gear warning sounds

I very much dislike the default callouts which come with X-Plane 11, so I'm slowly building up a set of replacements which I have sourced from various parts of the web.
I will replace the sounds with more authentic and higher quality recordings when I come across them. If you have any better sounds, please create a PR.

## Installation

### Step 1
Download the sourcecode zip file of the [latest release](https://github.com/andrewhawkes/x-plane-11-alert-sounds/releases) (or clone the repo).

### Step 2 (optional)
Backup your current alert sounds directory in X-Plane `\X-Plane 11\Resources\sounds\alert`. You can simply make a copy of the entire `alert` directory. I just named it `alert_backup`.

### Step 3
Copy the contents of the `Resources/sounds/alert` directory from the zip and paste it into the corresponding directory in your X-Plane 11 installation. E.g `\X-Plane 11\Resources\sounds\alert`.
Replace/overwrite the files which are already present. 

Installation is now complete. 

## Updates

### Adding new sounds
Simply follow the instructions for installation above to update when new sounds are added, excluding Step 2.

### Warnings when installing X-Plane 11 updates
When you install updates in X-Plane 11, it checks to see if any files have been modified, you may see a warning asking you if you wish to overwrite the sounds files.
Simply skip the overwriting and the custom sounds will not be replaced when updating. 

## Current sounds replaced
Here are the sounds which have been replaced already with this project:
- Glide slope alert
- Minimums callout 
- TCAS alert
- Windshear
- Gear alert (not extended/lowered)
- Sink rate alert
- Pull up callout
